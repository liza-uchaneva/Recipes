                            Borsch is one of the most well-known Slavic foods. 
                            It is a beet soup made with many other vegetables. This
                             version is made with beef, potatoes, cabbage, lots of aromatic 
                             vegetables and is served with fresh herbs and sour cream.

                            A warm bowl of soup so deliciously creamy with tender bites of mushroom pieces. Full flavoured with garlic, onions and herbs subtle enough
                             to shine through and compliment the natural flavour of mushrooms without overpowering it. Cooked with easy to find 
                            ingredients you may already have in your kitchen, you are minutes away from a satisfying bowl of creamy goodness!
