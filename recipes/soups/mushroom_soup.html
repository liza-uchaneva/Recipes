        <h2>What is mashroom soup?</h2>
        <p>Cream of mushroom soup is a simple type of soup where a basic roux is thinned with cream or milk and then mushrooms and/or mushroom broth are added. It is well known in North America as a common type of condensed canned soup. Cream of mushroom soup is often used as a base ingredient in casseroles and comfort foods. This use is similar to that of a mushroom-flavored gravy.</p>
        <p>This simple, delicious recipe is made without cream or milk. A mix of butter and flour thicken chicken stock to create a velvety soup without being too heavy. The combination of crimini and white button mushrooms add earthy notes that work well with the rich broth.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
                <li>4 ounces crimini mushrooms, chopped</li>
                <li>4 ounces white button mushrooms, chopped</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>0,25 teaspoon fine sea salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>0,25 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>Sliced saut√©ed mushrooms for garnish, optional</li>
                <li>Chopped parsley for garnish, optional</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare mushrooms and onions:</li>
            <p>Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large pot such as a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and shallot, cook for 1 minute, until they begin to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 3 minutes, until tender and browned. Transfer all the contents of the pot to a bowl.</p>
        
            <li>Make the sauce:</li>
            <p>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter to the pot. Once melted, sprinkle in the flour and whisk it quickly into a paste. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the stock a little at a time, whisking out the clumps between each addition.</p>
        
            <li>Mix the ingredients:</li>
            <p>Increase the heat back to medium-high and allow the soup to simmer well for 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms back to the pot and continue to cook for 2 more minutes. The stock will thicken slightly to be somewhat creamy.</p>
            
            <li>Finish cooking the soup:</li>
            <p>Let cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then ladle into bowls. Garnish with mushrooms and parsley, if desired.</p>
        </ol>
