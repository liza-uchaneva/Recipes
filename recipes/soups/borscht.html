        <h2>What is borscht?</h2>
        <p>
            Borscht is a soup, usually made with beets, originating from Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. It is especially popular in the cuisines of Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, and Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the beet version is the most well known, it doesn't have to be made with beets. Borscht was a winter soup, often made with sour flavors and topped with a dollop of sour cream.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was usually made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed or boiled vegetables. Popular ingredients may include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and/or tomatoes. Sometimes it's puréed; sometimes it's not. Sometimes there's meat; sometimes there's not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name of the ancient tart soup is now more associated with the beet-red soup of today. If you want to recreate that traditional tartness, you can serve with lemon wedges on the side or add more vinegar, to taste.

            <li>Finish cooking the soup:</li>
            <p>Return the pot to the stove and add the remaining broth, the carrots, beets, and potato. Add the chopped meat to the pot, the sliced cabbage, and a half cup of the fresh dill. Bring to a simmer, and cook for another 15 minutes or so, until the cabbage is cooked through.</p>

            <p>Add the vinegar and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. (I use about 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper, but the amount you use will depend on how salty your beef broth is to begin with.)</p>
            <p>The soup is best made a day ahead. (The longer the soup sits, the more it will all turn the deep red color of beets.)</p>
