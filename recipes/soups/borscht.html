        <h2>What is borscht?</h2>
        <p>
            Borscht is a soup, usually made with beets, originating from Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. It is especially popular in the cuisines of Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, and Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the beet version is the most well known, it doesn't have to be made with beets. Borscht was a winter soup, often made with sour flavors and topped with a dollop of sour cream.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was usually made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed or boiled vegetables. Popular ingredients may include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and/or tomatoes. Sometimes it's puréed; sometimes it's not. Sometimes there's meat; sometimes there's not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name of the ancient tart soup is now more associated with the beet-red soup of today. If you want to recreate that traditional tartness, you can serve with lemon wedges on the side or add more vinegar, to taste.

                    <li>1 large russet potato (6 ounces), peeled and cut into 0,5-inch cubes</li>
                    <li>2 cups thinly sliced cabbage</li>
                    <li>0,75 cup chopped fresh dill, divided</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the beef, then cook the onions:</li>
            <p>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat. Add the shank slice or stew beef. Let the beef brown lightly on one side, then turn over.</p>
            <p>Add the chopped onions to the pot. Let the onions cook and soften, about 5 minutes.</p>
            <li>Add 4 cups broth and simmer until the beef is tender:</li>
            <p>Pour 4 cups of the beef broth over the beef and onions in the pot. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.</p>
            <li>Meanwhile, prep and roast the root vegetables:</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
            <p>Peel and chop the beets, carrots, and potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss the beets and carrots with a teaspoon or two of olive oil and spread them out in a single layer on a foil lined roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes.</p>
            <p>Toss the potatoes with olive oil and make room for them in the roasting pan, and roast everything an additional 15 minutes.</p>
            <li>Remove the meat from the pot:</li>
            <p>Once the beef has cooked through until tender, remove from the pot, and take the pot off the heat. If you are using a beef shank, remove and discard any bone, connective tissue, and excess fat. Chop the meat into bite sized pieces.</p>
            <li>Skim the soup:</li>
            <p>Skim off any excess fat from the liquid in the pot.</p>
            <li>Finish cooking the soup:</li>
            <p>Return the pot to the stove and add the remaining broth, the carrots, beets, and potato. Add the chopped meat to the pot, the sliced cabbage, and a half cup of the fresh dill. Bring to a simmer, and cook for another 15 minutes or so, until the cabbage is cooked through.</p>
            <p>Add the vinegar and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. (I use about 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper, but the amount you use will depend on how salty your beef broth is to begin with.)</p>
            <p>The soup is best made a day ahead. (The longer the soup sits, the more it will all turn the deep red color of beets.)</p>
            <p>Serve ladled into bowls with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of fresh dill.</p>
        </ol>
